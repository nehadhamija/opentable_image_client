Image Client

The client is written in AngularJS. And is entirely codoed in index.html.

There are 2 tabs:

1. Upload Image
It has a form with file input, that accepts files in jpg format. Clicking on upload gets an upload link from the server and directly uploads the image to amazon s3 server.

2. View Images
The thumbnail versions of uploaded images can be viewed here. It gets list of s3 image urls from the server and renders them. It also registers to an evenetsource end-point on the server, to get updates on any new images in the thumbnail bucket. New images, once uploaded will appear at the bottom.
